    <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
    
    <h3> Baking</h3>
    
    <p> One of my favorite things to do is bake. Some of the things that I have baked are, Cakes Brownies, Pumkin Pie, and cookies. I usually dont bake alone. I bake with my best friend Abby. She is really nice and always knows when to laugh when we make a mistake. </p>
    
    
    <h3> Coloring/ Drawing </h3>
    
    <p> In my free time I like to color or draw. I am not really good at it but it is fun all the same. I like to color because it is time consuming and it gives me something to do when I am bored.</p>
   
    <h3> My Puppy</h3>
   
    <p> I have a German Shepherd puppy named Argus. Well he isent really a puppy any more. He will be 2 years old in March. He is very spoiled and well trained. </p>
